# üîê Secure AWS CI/CD Pipeline with RMF Controls

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to deploy a secure, serverless microservice using AWS Lambda and API Gateway, with a CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions. It integrates AWS-native security services to simulate a FedRAMP/FISMA-style compliance environment, following key NIST 800-53 controls. 

The goal is to highlight cloud security engineering skills relevant to federal and defense roles, including access control, encryption, vulnerability scanning, and audit logging. The project also includes mock documentation for a System Security Plan (SSP) and RMF control mappings.

## üìò Lessons Learned

Throughout building this secure AWS CI/CD demo project, several key takeaways emerged that are valuable for future cloud security and DevSecOps implementations:

### Principle of Least Privilege Matters
Reducing IAM permissions to the absolute minimum (e.g., inline CloudWatch-only policies) helped reinforce how overly permissive roles are often the weakest link in cloud environments. Even in a demo, fine-grained permissions improve security posture.

### Encryption Is Simple to Enable, Critical to Enforce
Enabling **SSE-KMS** or even **SSE-S3** proved how easy it is to enforce encryption-at-rest across S3. For production systems, pairing this with customer-managed KMS keys and CloudTrail alerts adds defense-in-depth.

### CloudTrail & Logging Aid in Root Cause Analysis
With **CloudTrail** and **CloudWatch Logs**, tracking events like Lambda invocation, S3 uploads, or role assumptions becomes auditable and traceable ‚Äî which is crucial for RMF compliance and incident response.

### Testing Serverless via API Gateway Offers Instant Feedback
Using API Gateway as a Lambda trigger provided real-time visibility into endpoint responses and how IAM or misconfigurations affect access or error codes.

### Documentation Matters (Even for Demos)
Even for non-production projects, documenting control mappings (e.g., to NIST 800-53) helped reinforce best practices. Creating a **System Security Plan (SSP)** outline gave structure to the security engineering process.

### CI/CD Is a Security Control (Not Just a Dev Tool)
Integrating GitHub Actions ‚Äî and later pairing it with tools like Checkov or AWS Inspector ‚Äî showed how CI/CD pipelines themselves can be an enforcement point for secure configurations and flaw remediation.
